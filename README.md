🌍 AI Travel Planner – Streamlit App
This project is a Streamlit-based AI travel planner that generates personalized and engaging travel itineraries using Google’s Gemini Pro model via the LangChain framework. 
Users input their departure and destination cities, travel dates, budget, interests, meal preferences, and any special requirements. The AI then responds with a detailed, day-by-day itinerary tailored to these preferences — 
without including any transportation details, focusing purely on the experience.

Each itinerary ensures a balance of culture, relaxation, adventure, and local exploration, highlighting hidden gems, authentic food spots, and cultural activities. 
The application is designed to help users effortlessly plan trips with minimal input, leveraging the power of Generative AI for a rich, narrative-based travel plan.
